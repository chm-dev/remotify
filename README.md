# Remotify

### Local REST API to interact with running Spotify desktop client.

It will take some more time, then I initially suspected :)

This is more of a proof of concept but it turned out to be very effective and capable.

Currently implemented actions include: 
* Connect to running spotify
* Restart or start Spotify in debug-mode
* Toggle Play / Pause
* Next Track
